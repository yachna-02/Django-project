## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Cardiotocography (CTG) is a crucial tool used in fetal monitoring during pregnancy. It measures **fetal heart rate (FHR)** and **uterine contractions (UC)**, which are vital indicators of fetal well-being. However, manual interpretation of CTG data can be inconsistent and prone to errors.  

This project introduces a machine learning-based system to automate and enhance fetal health assessment. It employs diverse algorithms, including traditional ML models like Logistic Regression and advanced architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs, to analyze CTG data efficiently.

### Objectives:
- Classify fetal health into **Normal**, **Suspect**, or **Pathological** categories.
- Assist clinicians with real-time, accurate predictions.
- Reduce errors and inconsistencies in manual CTG interpretation.
- Ensure timely medical interventions in critical cases.
